tiny-utf8
=========

Takes a hexadecimal codepoint from stdin and prints the resulting character to stdout. That's it.

Usage
-----

To build:
```
$ gcc tinyutf8.c -o tiny-utf8
```

To run:
```
$ echo 203d | tiny-utf8
â€½
```

Helper Script
-------------

I use the script unicode-select.sh to input characters for which I can't remember the compose key
sequence. It works with dmenu and rofi, meaning you can search for a character by its description.
Once selected, it will be inserted wherever the cursor is active. On my system, I have the ~/scripts
directory in my PATH, and have copied both UnicodeNamesList.txt and unicode-select.sh into it. I
also have the ~/bin directory in my PATH, into which I have placed the tiny-utf8 executable. The
most up-to-date version of the NamesList can always be found
[here](https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt). I am aware that the file explicitly states
that it is not to be parsed for machine-readable information. I do not care and have done it anyway.
